# Habit Tracker App using react JS

## Getting Started

The UX of this Habt Tracker app is based on two views: Detailed View and  Week View

Detailed View shows habits in their weekly tags; showing statuses ( Green for 'done', Red for 'Not done' ).

In both views, on top, 'Add Habit' dropdown is given to enter the habit name and create a habit entry.

For tracking last 6-7 days of habits, calendar has been implemented in Week View with only last 1 week being enabled.
A particular day can be selected out of this week to view the statuses of activities.

# Note: React-router is omitted, since I find it not much useful for this app having only 2 tabs. They are controlled via static routing through javascript .

To preserve state on refresh, right now local storage is being used; but can implement backend as well in future.

To run in the project in local environment:
1. First install dependencies via : npm i
2. then run: npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
